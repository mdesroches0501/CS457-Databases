# About the Project
This is a program that allows a database user to manage the metadata of their relational
data. By metadata, I mean the database’s own information (e.g., database’s name, creation time, owner) as well
as the properties of the tables (e.g., table’s names, attributes, constraints).

## Project Status
The foundations are here and Project 1 requirments seem to have been met accordingly

# Getting Started
