1. How program organizes multiple databases
    
    Program organizes databases as directories in the build folder by checking if databases
    already exists, if it doesn't it creates a new database with given argument as name

2. How program organizes multipe tables
    
    Program organizes tables as .txt files within a given database. First, it checks if the 
    user is inside of a database. If it is it will parse the commands given, otherwise prompt
    you to access a database first. Class "Table" holds all the values for the tables that are 
    created. 

3. How program joins two tuples form two source tables

    Variables are held for the user or .sql input. That input is then tokenized, then sanitized
    (/r's), then case changed. The input determines what the code will exectute
    waiting for a .exit command to complete. If the command is "INSERT INTO" the insert handler 
    will insert data into table if the table is found. Then a query handler outputs the 
    tuples on which it was commanded to do. First it tokenizes the command, then if the table is 
    found it compares the two index's of the table accordingly. Then, program joins two tuples 
    from two source tables depending on the input.
